# Studbud

With more iterations and further research from basis of A2, I began the 
prototyping of A3, the studbud web application.

Before actually building the skeletion of the application for further development,
I checked the proposal for a few extra times to find the potential painpoints of both 
during developing and actually using the website.

What could be painful? What should be removed? What should be added?

The first point is the color scheme of the whole website, the website color scheme 
is a purple - violet - pink spectrum. Which I thought was suiting but could also be
1. too bright to have displayed on the monitor 2. the overall 'annoyance' it might cause.
also for UX design, it should take in count that 1. all users have favourable color schemes 
as well as their study pattern (from research).

So, as a result, I think the final website should have a way, or a button for uses to adjust the
overall color scheme and maybe save their fav color. (Done through localstorage)

*was not achieved due to the complexity and its sorta off topic - will work on after submission

the second point is the music player. I was looking at implementing a spotify playlist  -
it was simple and takes no more than 2 lines of code. but to make the website a standalone application
I think its best that users can add their own songs and save to a local playlist. and instead of a 
windowed playlist, a simple line that shows song name and progression will do. 

functionality elements achieved: The hidden sidebar, the downdown button, tasklist, draggable kanban, add to a playlist, pomotimer and music player.

additional functionality that should be achieved based on the achived functionalities due to either time 
or technical skill limitations

1.what should the hidden sidebar do? it pretty empty rightnow. 2.better tasklist, how to link tasklist array to kanbanboard? 3. add playlist as localstorage
4. kanban was fine - was looking at making one with BARBEL - was not sure if it will be allowed but it would definelty add more functionality and UX.
5. Musicplayer - with that bar, how to fit in more functions ? maybe hide it and make it a floating, draggable icon.

Self-reflection during development:

with the lessons from DECO1016 AND INFO1110, I began the task by seperating all JS AND CSS files away from each other and 
make sure naming of classes do not overlap. I also kept my original attempt and insignt of "ALL PAGES should be on 1 HTML page" 

after finishing the assignment, i realised that despite a good iteration it is (minimize user actions and switch in actions),
it would cause the page be overfloated with elements and functions. so maybe open smaller in-page HTMLs would work better. 

The JS logics were fine - i was able to achieve basic wanted functionalities, but it was rather hard for me 
to come up with satisfying CSS elements - SCSS was implemented but I definelty need to learn more about a 
visually pleasing web layout and how to actually achieve it through more complicated CSS / SCSS

Its disappointing to only achived the basic functionalities despite the good amount of iterations from A2 due to limitations of 
both time and technical skill - also just the lack of aesthetic taste. 

in the holiday I will continuously work on this assignemnt with a better pace, finsihing each CSS+JS functionality with better 
visual updates and more logics in the JS. 

Overall an ok but far not satisfying, rather disappinting attempt of A3. Will defntly work on forming 
better Weblayout knowledge the the backend skill to achieve them,
